App to list al the products information and search feature by using Rest API call.

The application works like following:

1. It calls the API and list the information in order of descending product rating by default.
2. As the JSON returned, did not contain information for LIKES, I generated random numbers to assign to likes.
3. We can sort as per Rating or Likes both by clicking on top tabs.
4. If we click on top right search button, it will slide down the search bar where one can search using tags. Tags will be auto completely populate as you type.
5. If one clicks on any link of the product, it will open in a new window the respective link.
